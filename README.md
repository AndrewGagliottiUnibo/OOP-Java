# OOP-Java

This repository will contain all java code that I made in my exercises during class.
There will be several branches:
- Exercises (mine)
- Code in lessons (code made by professor Mirko Viroli): This code is the material that professor Mirko Viroli gave us during 2023 year of OOP course in University. I don't have a site to link because he gave these files to us by linking it in the university portal.
- Personal Tests

## License is valid for all branches.
